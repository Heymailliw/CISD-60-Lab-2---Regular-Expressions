why we need regular expression

Regular expressions (regex) are crucial for text processing due to their ability to define and search for complex patterns within strings. They are essential for validating input formats, such as email addresses or phone numbers, ensuring data meets specific criteria. Regex enables efficient data extraction, allowing you to pull out specific information from larger text bodies. Additionally, they support search and replace operations, making it easy to clean or format text. Regex can perform sophisticated text transformations and operations in a single line of code, enhancing efficiency. Their flexibility with pattern definitions makes them adaptable to various text processing needs. Integrated into many programming languages and tools, regex provides a universal solution for handling text data across different platforms.
